**Year 2 / Level 5: Machine Learning (5CS037) - Concepts and Technologies of AI (20 Credits)**  

This repository serves as a dedicated space for my **assignments**, **classwork**, **notes**, and everything I learn during the **Machine Learning (5CS037)** module. It will include:  
- **Lecture notes**: Summaries and key takeaways from each class(Semester I).  
- **Classwork and exercises**: Code snippets, algorithms, and hands-on practices.  
- **Assignments**: Solutions and documentation for coursework.  
- **Personal learning**: Insights, additional resources, and self-driven experiments.  

The goal of this repository is to document my journey and progress in learning the foundational concepts of machine learning and applying them to practical problems as part of my **Level 5 studies**.
